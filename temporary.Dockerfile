###! Additional info:
###! - Do not use sudo -> Set proper group permission
###! - Set variable SPEEDTEST_TRIES on the integer of expected speedtests
###!   - More tries -> More accurate result
###!   - Recommended value: 5
###! - Set variable APT_MIRROR on hard-codded mirror (stub in case gitpod will provide it's own mirror), speedtest will be performed anyway to verify that hardcoded mirror is faster then alternatives
